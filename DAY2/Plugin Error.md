* Version Compatability *
* Build Failure Reason *
The error you're encountering:

```
SonarQubeMojo has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0
```

means you're using a **Java Runtime (JDK 8)** to run a plugin (Sonar Maven Plugin 4.0.0.4121) that was compiled with **Java 11**.

### ðŸ’¡ Class file versions:

* 52.0 = Java 8
* 55.0 = Java 11

---

### âœ… Steps to Resolve the Issue

1. **Upgrade your Java version to Java 11 or newer**:

   * Make sure your system and `JAVA_HOME` environment variable use **JDK 11+**.
   * On Ubuntu/Debian:

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
     sudo update-alternatives --config java
     java -version  # Confirm version is 11+
     ```

2. **Update `JAVA_HOME` (if needed)**:

   * Example (Linux/macOS):

     ```bash
     export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
     export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
     ```
   * On Windows:

     * Go to System Properties â†’ Environment Variables.
     * Update `JAVA_HOME` to point to your Java 11 installation.
     * Restart your terminal/IDE.

3. **Verify the Java version used by Maven**:

   ```bash
   mvn -v
   ```

   Ensure it shows Java 11 or higher.

4. **Re-run the Sonar analysis**:

   ```bash
   mvn clean verify sonar:sonar
   ```
