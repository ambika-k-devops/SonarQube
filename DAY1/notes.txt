SonarQube by KK FUNDA
=====================


Explain the flow diagram ----> Before maven and tomcat ----> SonarQube.


Def:
---

-> SonarQube is an open-source platform used for continuous inspection of code quality. 

-> It performs static code analysis to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in your code.



Key Features
=============

Code Quality and Security
-------------------------

Bugs and Vulnerabilities ---> Detect and fix issues that might lead to bugs or security vulnerabilities.

Code Smells --> Identify maintainability issues in your code.

Code Coverage --> Measure how much of your code is covered by tests.

Duplication --> Detect duplicate code blocks.

Technical Debt --> Estimate the effort required to fix all the issues in the code.


Multi-Language Support
----------------------

Supports a wide range of programming languages including Java, JavaScript, C#, C++, Python, PHP, and many more.

Quality Gates
-------------
Set thresholds for quality metrics to ensure code meets the standards before it is integrated into the main branch.

what is the diff between code review and code coverage?
=========================================================

code coverage:
--------------

Number of lines tested through unit test cases called as code coverage.

In any project 80% need to satisfy.

Benefits: Helps identify untested areas of code

Tools: Tools like JaCoCo (for Java)



code review:
------------

Code review is the process of manually reviewing code by team members to find bugs, ensure to following  coding standards, and improve overall code quality.

Benefits: It Leads to better software quality, fewer bugs, and promotes best practices within the development team.

Tools: Code review tools include GitHub Pull Requests.

more information about SonarQube
---------------------------------

--> SonarQube previously called as a Sonar , It is open source software quality management tool.
--> It will continuosly analyze and measures quality of a source code.
--> In case any issues found, It will generate in html format/ PDF format reports.
--> It supports multiple languages like JAVA, c#, Java Script etc [Initially It was developed for JAVA]
--> It is supporting OS like mac,Linux, windows , etc
--> It will support multiple DBs like MYSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc
--> It will supports multile browsers like chrome, safari, IE, Microsoft edge, etc
--> It will identify the bwlow issues:
   1. Duplicate code
   2. Coding standards
   3. unit test cases
   4. complex code
   5. comments
   6. potential bugs [ Exception handlings]
   .........

NOTE: with the help of SonarQube report we can stop the deployment also.










prerequsites for SonarQube Installation
=======================================


To install SonarQube, certain prerequisites must be met in terms of software and hardware requirements.

Below are the detailed prerequisites for installing SonarQube:

1. Hardware Requirements
------------------------
CPU: Modern multi-core processor.

RAM: At least 2GB of RAM (4GB recommended for production).  go for t2.medium

Disk Space: 1GB of free disk space for the SonarQube installation, plus additional space for the database.

2. Software Requirements
------------------------
Operating System
-----------------
Linux (preferred)
Windows
macOS

Java
----
Java JDK 11 or 17
SonarQube requires the Java JDK (not just the JRE).
Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JDK installation.

DB
--
Oracle
MYSQL  --> Removed
MS SQL SERVER
POSTGRE SQL 

DB is optional, Because of H2 is inbuild DB for SonarQube.




SonarQube installation
======================

step 1: launch t2.medium machine [4GB]

step 2: connect to that server

step 3: switch to root user [ sudo su - ]

step 4: install java

   sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel -y
  
   javac --version

step 5: go to /opt dir

  cd /opt

step 6: yum install wget unzip -y

step 7: wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-9.6.1.59531.zip




step 7.1 : unzip sonarqube-9.6.1.59531.zip

step 8: mv sonarqube-9.6.1.59531 sonarqube

step 9:  *************
 As a good security practice, SonarQuber Server is not advised to run sonar service as a root user, so create a new user called sonar user  and grant sudo access to manage nexus services as follows.


useradd sonar

step 10: 

Give the sudo access to sonar user

visudo

sonar   ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

step 11:

Change the owner and group permissions to /opt/sonarqube/ directory.


chown -R sonar:sonar /opt/sonarqube/
chmod -R 775 /opt/sonarqube/
su - sonar
cd /opt/sonarqube/bin/linux-x86-64/

sh sonar.sh start
sh sonar.sh status
sh sonar.sh stop
sh sonar.sh restart


step 12: Now you can try to access the SonarQube Server.

NOTE: default port number for Sonarqubr server: 9000

http://15.207.110.48:9000

NOTE: pls make sure to alolw traffic for 9000 port.

step 13: refresh the page

  default credentials:  uname: admin   pwd: admin

stpe 14: It will ask to change the password


================================================================================================


Trouble shooting
=================
1. sonar user
2. traffic enabled or not
3. Java installed or not.
4. min 4GB RAM machine
